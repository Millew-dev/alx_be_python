# Define the variables
number1 = 10

# Calculating the sum, difference, and product
sum = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

# Printing the results
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product}")
